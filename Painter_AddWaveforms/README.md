# Painter AddWaveforms
The Labber Driver Painter AddWaveforms is a signal generator/analyzer built to add two waveforms. It takes two input waveforms (assuming same time steps) and generates an output that's the sum of the two. Intended to provide more flexibility while generating sequences. The input and output traces are chosen in the signal connections dialog of the Measurement Editor.
