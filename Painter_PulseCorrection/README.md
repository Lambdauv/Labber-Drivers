# Painter PulseCorrection
The Labber Driver Painter PulseCorrection is signal generator/analyzer built to correct for pulse distortions arising from the elements that we install on the line. Bias Tees installed on flux bias line is a good example of what we are trying to correct for. The transfer function (Fourier transform of the impulse response) must be specified in the Labber log format
